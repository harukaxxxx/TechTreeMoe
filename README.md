TechTreeMoe is a fan work based world of warships mod.<br>
So I decide do not put any ad in website.<br>

# Production guide

These guide let you know how I make TTM and what I expect.

## Material choosing guide

Fill up tech tree is the reason I make this mod and the top priority.<br>
I also make a [statistic](https://techtreemoe.makinoworks.com/#/charts) page to track this progressive.<br>
And I following some rule like below to choosing material.

**1. New ship release**  
If there have new ship release from WOWS, I'll work on it first.<br>
However if no corresponding material, I'll try to fill up by next rule.

**2. Same class ship**  
Same class is second priority in choosing materials.<br>
If there have same class ship material, I'll put it in.<br>
I also provide some same class warship girl even it already have some material, so user can choose it by their preference.

**3. Same name ship**  
This happen on some low tier World War I warships.<br>
Most pupulor warship girl games is based on World War II background, so it's hard to find correspongding material.<br>
So if there doesn't have corresponding material for those World War I warship, I'll try put same name ship on it.<br>

**4. Fan art**  
Fan art isn't belong rules above, however it won't be first priority in choosing material.<br>
Fan art will be pick when I can't find any material in warship girl games, and I'll try to find great fan art to make it. (by my personal opinion)<br>
I also provide some fan art even it already have some material, so user can choose it by their preference.<br>

## Ship preview image guide

I creating ship preview image according some rules.<br>
It's a rule but not absolutely.<br>
I'll try to make image looks more good even though I need to break this guide in sometime.

**1. Base direction**  
The base direction is left to right just for neat.  
WOWS warships always facing right, so that is why all character standing left side.

**2. Character pose direction**  
Character have many pose in different case.  
Most character is facing and posing one way, but in some case it will not like this.  
![pgsc105-2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harukaxxxx/TechTreeMoe/master/public/img/ship_previews/PGSC105-2.png)  
Königsberg in 戰艦少女 is an case that facing right but posing left, and in this case I will try to catch character's focus direction to choose whether to flip.

**3. Equipment set**  
Some times shipgirls have huge equipment for her, and which is unique.  
![pgsa508-1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harukaxxxx/TechTreeMoe/master/public/img/ship_previews/PGSA508-1.png)  
Graf Zeppelin in 艦隊收藏 is a case.  
So I decide to use original image without flip, that cause character facing left.

**4. Character size**  
**Head to top. Absolute region to bottom.**  
Main rule like above, with additional rules like below

1. Let head being 1/3~1/4 image height.
2. If character not standing, try to show thigh or skirt end.
3. If character wearing long clothes like kimono, try to let invisible thigh to bottom.
4. If character is child girl, try to fit rule above but not necessary.

### Example

![pfsb108-1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harukaxxxx/TechTreeMoe/master/public/img/ship_previews/PFSB108-1.png)<br>
Richelieu in 艦隊收藏 is a general case.<br>
Facing and posing one direction and equipment also setting same direction, only need to flip to fit point 1 above.
